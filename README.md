**Moderator:**  
"Welcome to the conversation today about leadership strategies for addressing moral dilemmas in the medical field. How would your leadership approach handle the integration of AI while protecting patient data privacy, Drs. Priya and Arjun?"

**Dr. Priya Rao (Transformational Leader):**  
"I'm grateful. In my opinion, as transformational leaders, we must prioritize ethics while motivating our teams to seek out novel solutions. One example of how technology might improve medical care without sacrificing privacy is Narayana Nethralaya's AI research for predicting the severity of conjunctivitis. By emphasizing teamwork, I would enable groups to create safe, scalable AI solutions, such as the KIDROP telemedicine project, which transformed rural baby care via moral innovation.”

**Dr. Arjun Iyer (Transactional Leader):**  
“I appreciate that perspective, Dr. Priya, but as a transactional leader, I prioritize strict adherence to regulations like India’s Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB). While AI offers immense potential, clear frameworks are vital to mitigate risks. For example, in a program like KIDROP, I’d ensure robust data encryption, audit trails, and measurable compliance metrics to guarantee patient trust while achieving efficiency.”

**Dr. Priya:**  
“Your emphasis on regulations is crucial, but excessively strict frameworks might inhibit innovation. Take the application of AI biomarkers by Narayana Nethralaya, which was able to predict the severity of conjunctivitis with 97% accuracy. The team's encouragement to look beyond limitations made this progress feasible. An environment that is open and encouraging is conducive to ethical innovation.”

**Dr. Arjun:**  
“That's true, but privacy violations shouldn't be the price of ingenuity. Data security is guaranteed by a methodical approach without impeding advancement. For instance, I would motivate teams to integrate innovation with responsibility by tying rewards to compliance targets. This method preserves patient trust while promoting moral results.”

**Moderator:**  
“Excellent observations! How would you handle team opposition to putting ethics ahead of quick AI deployment, Dr. Priya?”

**Dr. Priya:**  
“I would share success stories like the KIDROP initiative, which used telemedicine in an ethical way to prevent blindness in over 2,000 premature infants." Storytelling ensures alignment with values by helping teams understand the "why" underlying moral behavior.”

**Dr. Arjun:**  
“Measurable incentives are another way to overcome resistance. Teams that achieve performance and ethical standards, for example, may be recognized or certified. By associating rewards with compliance, accountability is guaranteed and engagement is encouraged.”

**Moderator:**  
“I appreciate both of your viewpoints. It is evident that both leadership philosophies provide useful approaches to dealing with moral dilemmas in Indian healthcare.”
