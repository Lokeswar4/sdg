**Moderator:**  
“Welcome to today’s discussion on leadership approaches to ethical challenges in healthcare. Dr. Priya and Dr. Arjun, how would your leadership style address the integration of AI while safeguarding patient data privacy?”

**Dr. Priya Rao (Transformational Leader):**  
“Thank you. As a transformational leader, I believe we must inspire our teams to pursue innovative solutions while prioritizing ethics. For instance, Narayana Nethralaya’s AI project for predicting conjunctivitis severity demonstrated how technology can enhance patient care without compromising privacy. By focusing on collaboration, I’d empower teams to develop scalable, secure AI tools like the KIDROP telemedicine initiative, which revolutionized rural infant care through ethical innovation.”

**Dr. Arjun Iyer (Transactional Leader):**  
“I appreciate that perspective, Dr. Priya, but as a transactional leader, I prioritize strict adherence to regulations like India’s Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB). While AI offers immense potential, clear frameworks are vital to mitigate risks. For example, in a program like KIDROP, I’d ensure robust data encryption, audit trails, and measurable compliance metrics to guarantee patient trust while achieving efficiency.”

**Dr. Priya:**  
“Your focus on rules is important, but overly rigid structures can stifle creativity. Consider Narayana Nethralaya’s use of AI biomarkers, which achieved 97% accuracy in predicting conjunctivitis severity. This progress was possible because the team was encouraged to think beyond constraints. Ethical innovation flourishes in an open, supportive environment.”

**Dr. Arjun:**  
“That’s true, but creativity should not come at the cost of privacy breaches. A structured approach ensures data security without halting progress. For example, I’d tie rewards to compliance benchmarks, motivating teams to align innovation with accountability. This approach fosters ethical outcomes while maintaining patient trust.”

**Moderator:**  
“Great insights! Dr. Priya, how would you address team resistance to prioritizing ethics over rapid AI deployment?”

**Dr. Priya:**  
“I’d share success stories like the KIDROP initiative, which prevented blindness in over 2,000 premature infants by ethically using telemedicine. Storytelling connects teams to the ‘why’ behind ethical practices, ensuring alignment with values.”

**Dr. Arjun:**  
“Resistance can also be addressed through measurable incentives. For instance, teams that meet ethical and performance goals could receive certifications or recognition. Linking compliance to rewards ensures accountability while fostering engagement.”

**Moderator:**  
“Thank you both for your perspectives. It’s clear that both leadership styles offer valuable strategies for navigating ethical challenges in Indian healthcare.”
